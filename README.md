# xv6 Kernel Study

This is a repository of the codes that I made from July 12 to 23, 2021, studying the xv6 kernel.
I used [xv6 book](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf) and [xv6 indexed/cross referenced code](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/xv6-rev9.pdf) as main resources, and followed the labs [on this site](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~csong/cs153/19s/xv6.html).

Each repository is the process or result of each lab. Please find more details from the README of each repository.
